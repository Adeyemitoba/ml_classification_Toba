## 👥 Author of Reviewed Project
[Notebook Reviewed](https://github.com/Adeyemitoba/ml_classification_Toba/blob/main/classification_Toba.ipynb)

---

### 🗂️ 1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is clearly structured and professionally formatted. Each section is properly numbered and labeled, making it easy to follow the machine learning workflow. Markdown cells provide context and explanations, and visualizations are appropriately used to support insights. The author has followed the project structure accurately.

✅ *Excellent structure and readability.*

---

### 🎯 2. Feature Selection & Justification
The student used all four available numerical features (`variance`, `skewness`, `kurtosis`, `entropy`) which are relevant to the target variable (`class`). The reasoning for selecting all features is valid given their mathematical representation of banknote characteristics.

✅ *Good feature justification, and no obvious features were left out.*

---

### 📈 3. Model Performance & Comparison
Two classification models were implemented: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Both models were evaluated using classification reports and confusion matrices. Random Forest slightly outperformed Logistic Regression in accuracy and recall.

✅ *Good comparison with visual and metric-based evidence.*

---

### 💬 4. Reflection Quality
Reflections are thoughtful and demonstrate a solid understanding of the process. Challenges were mentioned (e.g., missing headers, class balance), and next steps were realistically outlined, including ideas like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

✅ *Strong reflections showing critical thinking.*

### ⭐ Overall Feedback
This is a well-executed classification project that showcases technical proficiency and clear communication. The notebook is easy to read, and the models are well-explained and evaluated.

🎉 **Great job! Very little to improve — maybe just experiment with more models like SVM or XGBoost if time permits.**
